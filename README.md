# pollard-rho-factoriser

Factor numbers into prime factors using the Pollard-Rho algorithm and
verifying primality with the Miller-Rabin test.

Currently programmed to factor `SSN * (10 ^ 6 + j) + i` in the range
given as arguments.

The Quadratic Sieve is not implemented.

This project was made for the DD2440 Advanced Algorithms course at
KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
